Initially developed for vimuiex (vimscript#2606)
Used by manuals (vimscript#3060)

Contains a Vim Plugin Generator that parses files in autoload directories and creates 
plugin initialization code for the plugin directory - a single file for all plugins. 
It searches for specially marked sections in vim files (see vimuiex, manuals).

See http://vimuiex.sourceforge.net/vimdoc/vxlib_plugin.html for details.

The command :VxRegen will start the plugin generator, create the plugin 
initialization code and update the plugin configuration file (plugins/vxplugin.conf).  
:VxRegen will execute a Python script using an existing Python installation, so 
Python must be in your system PATH. 

The configuration file can be edited with :VxConfig. It is a simple win-ini-type 
file. Currently it is only possible to include/exclude the plugins from the 
initialization code. To exclude a plugin, put 'generate=0' in the appropriate 
sections. By default initialization code for all found plugins is generated.

Generated plugins can also be disabled from .vimrc. Each plugin processed by the 
plugin generator has a unique ID. When the plugins are loaded, this ID is used to 
check if the plugin should be loaded or not. To disable a plugin with 
id='vimuiex#textmenu', add 'let g:vxenabled_vimuiex_textmenu=0' to .vimrc.
